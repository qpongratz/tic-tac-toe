# tic-tac-toe
A tic tac toe game made to learn factory functions in JS with [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/javascript-tic-tac-toe).

## Instructions
Check out the [live verstion]() to play a match with a friend or just watch the two computers duke it out. Alternately, clone the repository to your machine and open the index.html page to get started locally.

## Learning Goals and Notes
- This was just a simple project to explore and solidfy understanding of factory fucntions and module patterns.
- They actually didn't feel too far off from classes that I'm used to in Ruby, but the syntax of gettin them set up took some getting used to.
- I started work on a move scorer for the computer players to pick the best move available, but ran into some issues with how my code for the rest of it had been setup. It will take a bit more work to get it going, but I do plan to return and conquer that after a break fro other projects. The logic of it is something I've done before similar to the mastermind AI in ruby, but I either need to change my way of thinking with how the rest of the code is organized or change the rest of the code and I haven't picked a way forward yet.
